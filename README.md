# TrussStructuralOptimization
The files in this repository are meant to accompany the book titled,  "Introduction to Structural Optimization: Truss Analysis Using the Principles of Finite Element Analysis, Genetic Algorithms and Python". The files are organized by chapter and include Python Programs, high resolution images from the book, STL models and the odd data set. The book itself is meant to be an in depth walkthrough of the development of several relatively complex programs designed to perform truss structural analysis and optimization using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to understand the engineering and mathematical concepts behind the study of relatively simple truss structures. The study of trusses is a means to gain essential skills and knowledge necessary to build and operate even more complex programs aimed at optimizing solid structures, for example. Enjoy!
